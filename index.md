[have to be updated] I am a second year Master Student at MIPT also I do research at Bayes Group under supervision of prof. Dmitry Vetrov. My research is focused on Bayesian deep neural nets. At MIPT, MSU, HSE I teach several Machine Learning courses.

My resume is available [here](resume/ashukha-resume.pdf).

## News 
- We released preprint on [Structured Bayesian Pruning via Log-Normal Multiplicative Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07283), code will be avalible soon.
- Our [Variational Dropout Sparsifies DNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05369) paper was accepted to ICMLâ€™17.
- I joined [HSE Bayesian Deep Learning Lab](https://cs.hse.ru/en/big-data/bayeslab), here is my [hse home page](https://www.hse.ru/en/org/persons/204848606).
